# Setaria-pan-genome

Here, we *de novo* assembled 110 representative *Setaria* accessions from a worldwide collection of 1,844 varieties. We establish the importance of pan-genome variation in foxtail millet domestication and improvement for important agronomic traits. We developed a graph-based genome and performed large-scale genetic studies for 68 traits across 13 environments. Our work identifies key agronomic genes and marker panels for foxtail millet improvement at different geographic sites; these can be used in marker assisted breeding, genomic selection and/or genome editing that can accelerate crop improvement to meet agricultural demands under different climatic conditions.
