# HERA (Highly Efficient Repeat Assembly)
# Introduction
HERA is a local assembly tool using assembled contigs and self-corrected long reads as input. HERA is highly efficient using SMS data to resolve repeats, which enables the assembly of highly contiguous genomes. With the help of BioNano genome maps and chromosomal anchoring information, HERA can generate ultra-long, even chromosome-scale, contigs. 

It is important to note that even though HERA can be used to improve the sequence contiguity of highly heterozygous genomes, it require HiC data (and better also with BioNano data) to resolve the haplotype sequences. A new pipeline to do this is being developed but it is not included here.

# Installation

The running of HERA requires a few other software programs. 
1. Downloading and installing bwa-0.7.10
   
   git clone https://github.com/lh3/bwa.git  
   cd bwa; make.
2. Downloading and installing DALIGNER

   https://github.com/thegenemyers/DALIGNER
3. Downloading and installing DAZZ_DB

   https://github.com/thegenemyers/DAZZ_DB
   
 # The example of running HERA
 
 Assume the working directory is "~/"
 
 1. Download and unzip HERA, and then generate a folder named "HERAv1.0-master". 
    
    unzip HERAv1.0-master.zip
    
 2. Set scripts to executable.
    
    cd HERAv1.0-master/ && chmod 777 *
    
 3. Generate the folder name "Test" and files for testing.
 
    cd ../ && mkdir Test
    
    cd Test/ && cp ../HERAv1.0-master/pipeline.sh ./
    
    mv ../HERAv1.0-master/*.fasta ./
    
 4. Modify the configuration part in pipeline.sh.

    set genome_seq=~/Test/Test_Genome.fasta
    
    set Corrected_Pacbio=~/Test/Test_CorrectedPacbio.fasta
    
    set Working_Script=~/HERAv1.0-master/
    
    set DAZZ_DB=~/DAZZ_DB-master/
    
    set DALIGNER=~/DALIGNER-master/
    
      
 5. Run the pipeline.sh, assuming that the job scheduling system of the cluster has been configured in the scripts of "04-Qsub-Mapping2Ctg.pl", "08-qsub_job_index.pl", "21-Daligner_New.pl" and "09-Qsub-Pair_Alignment.pl".
 
    sh pipeline.sh
    

   
# Quick Start

### Step 0: Correct the noisy long reads by CANU and finish genome assembly by CANU or MECAT, or FALCON or other assemblers to generate contigs with high sequence accuracy.

### Step 1: Create a config file

Before running HERA, you need to create a config file template. HERA provides two kinds of running patterns for connecting the whole-genome assembled contigs and filling the gaps between the paired contigs with or without the BioNano maps.  

The template looks like
``` shell

############################### the parameters that can be changed by users ##########################################
#the genome name(less than 5 words)
############################### the parameters which users can reset ##########################################
#the genome name(less 5 words)
genome_name=DJ

#the whole genome assembled sequences with absolute path
genome_seq=~/home/Genome.fasta

#the corrected pacbio file with absolute path
Corrected_Pacbio=~/home/correctedpacbio.fasta

#the enzyme used to form the bionano map(if no bionano maps, neglect this parameter)
Enzyme=GCTCTTC

#the software with absolute path
Working_Script=~/home/HERA-master/
#the queue used to bsub jobs
queue=low

#DAZZ_DB with absolute path
DAZZ_DB=~/Genome_Assembly/software/DAZZ_DB-master/

#DALIGNER with absolute path
DALIGNER=~/Genome_Assembly/software/DALIGNER-master/

#the positions apart from start or end
InterIncluded_Side=25000

#internal pacbios and contigs 
InterIncluded_Identity=99;
InterIncluded_Coverage=99;

#the pacbios selected for starting and ending
MinIdentity=98
MinCoverage=90
MinLength=5000

#the conditions used to filter the overlap used to construct the graph
MinIdentity_Overlap=97
MinOverlap_Overlap=1000
MaxOverhang_Overlap=100
MinExtend_Overlap=1000

#the min num path for contig pairs
MinPathNum=6

#the conditons used to merge the supercontigs and non-scaffolded contigs
MinIdentity_Merge=98
MinOverlap_Merge=10000
MaxOverhang_Merge=200

############################### end of resetting parameters ##################################################
```
you need to fill and modify the relevant information, such as the whole genome assembled contigs or scaffold and the self-corrected long reads.

### Step 2: Running HERA

```Shell
$ sh pipeline.sh
```
Users need to note that HERA currently only supports LSF job scheduling system, and we are trying to adapt HERA to different types of cluster job systems. While users can manually modify the configuration section of job system in scripts of "04-Qsub-Mapping2Ctg.pl", "08-qsub_job_index.pl", "21-Daligner_New.pl" and "09-Qsub-Pair_Alignment.pl" to fit your job system. It should be emphasized here that after the modification, users need to ensure the uniformaity of the way HERA submits and monitors jobs .

Example like
```Shell
#BSUB -J $genome-Pair-$i-$j
#BSUB -o $count.out
#BSUB -n 1
#BSUB -q $queue
```

# Results

After the successful submission of pipeline.sh, HERA will take a few steps to get the reassembled genome sequences with the name of "genome_name-Final_Genome_HERA.fasta". HERA mainly includes the following five parts: 
1. Mapping the corrected pacbio long reads to the whole genome assembled contigs;
2. Filtering the corrected pacbio long reads which are used to assemble the contigs;
3. Constructing the Contig-Reads and Reads-Reads overlaping graph;
4. Traversing the overlapping graph taking the contig nodes as start and end to find the connecting paths;
5. Constructing and traversing the contig-to-contig path graph to define the order and orientation of the contigs;
6. Constructing the consensus sequence to fill the gap and produce the final genome.

Finally, the users can get the super-contig genome and the connection information by HERA in the 06-Daligner/Selected_Path.txt and 06-Daligner/Ctg_Position.txt.

```Shell
$ ll -rth ./06-Daligner/
SuperContig_Part_Info.txt
SuperContig.fasta
Selected_Path.txt
Ctg_Position.txt
```

# Usage Limitations

HERA is highly efficient for generating highly contiguous and complete or nearly complete sequences for small genomes such as fungi as well as homozygous genomes. HERA may be applied to a genome for several rounds to get desired results. For highly heterozygous genomes, a lot of manual work may be required.
